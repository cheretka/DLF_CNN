# own CNN implementation

Implementation of 8 classes:

- [x] Sequential class
   - work on images as input, both B&W (single channel) and colour (three channels)
   - add() function
- [x] Dense class
   - Param: number of neurons, input shape (not mandatory), activation (Sigmoid, ReLU, TanH, Softmax)
- [x] Conv2D class
   - Param: number of filters, size of filters, stride, input shape (not mandatory), activation (Sigmoid, ReLU, TanH, Softmax)
- [x] Flatten class
- [x] Dropout class
   - Param: rate
- [x] MaxPooling2D class
   - Param: pool_size
- [x] Loss functions
   - Cross-entropy class, 
   - MSE class
